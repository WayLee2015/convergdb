* Initial release of library separate from ConvergDB gem.
* Created unit tests for Pyspark.
* Tested locally and in AWS Glue environment.

Note that the unit tests still have some gaps, mostly around the interactions with AWS services such as S3 and Athena. The Pyspark functional layers are all tested.
